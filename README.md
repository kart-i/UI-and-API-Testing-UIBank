About Application : 

UI Bank is a web-based application designed to simulate the functionality of modern banking software. It provides users with features such as account management, fund transfers, transaction history, loan applications, and other financial services. This application is developed to showcase or mimic real-world banking operations, making it useful for learning, testing, or demonstration purposes.

The objective of this assignment is to understand the Hybrid framework and write testcases for both UI and API testing.

1. Testcase is written to create an account from the UI automatically using Selenium.
2. Whereby, a testcase is written to validate the created account through REST API using Rest-Assured Library.
